# ✅ **FIXED: Videos Now Record for Both Tests!**

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**

Your issue where **only the second test's video was being recorded** has been fixed!

## 🔍 **What Was the Problem:**

When running tests with separate `playwright test` commands like this:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/scheduleCreation.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/settings_creation.spec.js
```

Each command would run independently and potentially overwrite the previous test's results, causing only the last test's video to be preserved.

## ✅ **The Solution:**

### 1. **Single Test Execution:**
Now the script runs all tests in **one command**:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/scheduleCreation.spec.js tests/settings_creation.spec.js
```

### 2. **Sequential Execution Configuration:**
Updated `playwright.config.js`:
```javascript
fullyParallel: false,    // Run tests sequentially
workers: 1,              // Use single worker
video: 'on',            // Record ALL tests
```

### 3. **Enhanced Video Reporting:**
The script now shows exactly which videos were recorded:
```
📹 Videos (3 recorded):
   • scheduleCreation Dynamic Schedule Creation Form Submission
   • settings_creation Create S d5a6b with Specific Schedule Name  
   • settings_creation Create S 903c0 r Recently Created Schedule
```

## 🎬 **Current Video Status:**

✅ **Schedule Creation Test**: Video recorded  
✅ **Settings Creation Test**: Videos recorded (both test cases)  

**Total Videos**: 3 video files generated

## 📁 **Video File Locations:**

```
test-results/
├── scheduleCreation-Dynamic-Schedule-Creation-Form-Submission-chromium/
│   └── video.webm                    ← Schedule Creation video
├── settings_creation-Create-S-d5a6b-with-Specific-Schedule-Name-chromium/
│   └── video.webm                    ← Settings Creation video #1
└── settings_creation-Create-S-903c0-r-Recently-Created-Schedule-chromium/
    └── video.webm                    ← Settings Creation video #2
```

## 🚀 **How to Use:**

```bash
# Run all tests with video recording
npm test

# The script will now:
# 1. Run both tests in single execution
# 2. Generate videos for ALL tests
# 3. Show video count and details
# 4. Open HTML report with embedded videos
```

## 📊 **HTML Report:**

The HTML report now includes:
- ✅ **All test results** in one report
- ✅ **Embedded videos** for each test
- ✅ **Complete test timeline**
- ✅ **No missing recordings**

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made:**

### `playwright.config.js`:
- `fullyParallel: false` - Sequential test execution
- `workers: 1` - Single worker to prevent conflicts
- `video: 'on'` - Record all tests
- `outputDir: 'test-results'` - Consistent output directory

### `scripts/run-all-tests.js`:
- Single command execution for all tests
- Enhanced video reporting with counts
- Better artifact information display

**Your videos are now working perfectly for both tests!** 🎉

## 📝 **Next Steps:**

1. Run `npm test` 
2. Check the video count in the output
3. View the HTML report to see all videos embedded
4. All test recordings will be preserved! 🎬
