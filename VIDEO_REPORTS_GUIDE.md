# 🎬 Video Recording & HTML Reports

## ✅ **Fixed: Video Recording & Reports Now Working!**

Your tests now automatically generate:

- **📹 Video recordings** for all tests (not just failures)
- **📊 Rich HTML reports** with embedded videos
- **📸 Screenshots** on test failures
- **🔍 Traces** for debugging failed tests

## 🚀 **How to Use:**

### **Run Tests with Reports:**

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
npm test

# The script will now ask:
# "Open HTML report after completion? (Y/n):"
```

### **View Reports Later:**

```bash
# Open the HTML report
npm run report

# Or open report accessible from network
npm run report:open
```

## 📁 **Generated Files:**

```

└── data/
    ├── *.json             ← Test data
    └── attachments/       ← Videos and screenshots

│   ├── trace.zip          ← Debug trace (if retried)
│   └── test-failed-1.png  ← Screenshot (if failed)
└── results.json           ← JSON results
```

## 🎯 **What's Different Now:**

### **Before:**

- ❌ Videos only on failures
- ❌ Basic console output
- ❌ No comprehensive reports

### **After:**

- ✅ Videos for ALL tests
- ✅ Rich HTML reports with embedded videos
- ✅ Automatic report opening
- ✅ Multiple report formats (HTML, JSON, Console)
- ✅ Screenshots on failures
- ✅ Debug traces for troubleshooting

## 📊 **HTML Report Features:**

The HTML report includes:

- **📈 Test results summary** with pass/fail statistics
- **📹 Embedded videos** for each test step
- **📸 Screenshots** of failures
- **⏱️ Execution timing** and performance metrics
- **🔍 Detailed logs** and console output
- **🎯 Test filters** by status, browser, project
- **📱 Responsive design** for mobile viewing

## 🔧 **Configuration:**

The video and reporting settings are in `playwright.config.js`:

```javascript
// Current settings:
video: 'on',                    // ← Videos for all tests
screenshot: 'only-on-failure',  // ← Screenshots on failures
trace: 'on-first-retry',        // ← Traces for retried tests

reporter: [
  ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],  // ← HTML report
  ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }], // ← JSON results
  ['list'] // ← Console output during tests
],
```

## 🎬 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run your tests**: `npm test`
2. **Answer "Y"** when asked about opening the report
3. **Browse the rich HTML report** with videos
4. **Use `npm run report`** anytime to view the last report

Your test reports are now comprehensive and include full video recordings! 🚀
